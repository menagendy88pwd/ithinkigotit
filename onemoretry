 Zelle:  
   Releases:
   Releasing an application is taking/deploying it to the client
   In realtime we have multiple Releases.  


   Release Code1 = version 1  = 1000 lines of code
   echo "Welcome to Zelle"

  Release Code2 = version 2   = 2000 lines of codes
  echo "Welcome to Zelle"  
  echo "Your convenient payment gateway"

  Release Code3  = version 3  = 3000 lines of code  
  echo "Welcome to Zelle"  
  echo "Your convenient payment gateway"
  echo "Zellers the best payment gateway"


Rollout   --> version1 --> version2 ---> version3

RollBack  --> version3 --> version2 


The client is not happy with the latest version of the application.   
What can we do??? RollBack
